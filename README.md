# Doubletalk-Detection

This project is a study that addresses several important issues related to acoustic/line echo cancellation (AEC/LEC), particularly the double talk and echo path. Correct routing and processing of the Acoustic Echo Cancellation (AEC) reference is critical to avoiding echo. Echo cancellation is done by using both echo suppressors and echo cancellers, or in a few cases both. An important aspect of echo cancellers is the ability to maintain full duplex conversation allowing every speaker to speak at the same time. The aim of these studies is to produce an improved echo cancellation algorithm that can produce convincing results. The three basic components of an echo canceller are an adaptive filter, a double speech detector, and a nonlinear processor. A simulation on MATLAB was obtained using echo cancellation. Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) or Mean Squared Error (MSE) was calculated to measure the performance of the project.
